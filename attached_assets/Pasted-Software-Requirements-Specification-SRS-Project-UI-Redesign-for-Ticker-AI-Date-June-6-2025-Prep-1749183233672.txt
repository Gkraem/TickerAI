Date: June 6, 2025
Prepared by: [Your Name / Team Name]

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This SRS outlines the requirements to redesign the user interface (UI) of the existing Ticker AI web platform. The primary goal is to modernize the visual design and layout while maintaining all current backend functionality. Special attention will be given to mobile responsiveness and consistent theming across all screens, including sign-on and create account windows.

1.2 Scope
This redesign will focus on the front-end interface only, retaining all backend data, logic, and user accounts (currently 9 registered users). The redesign will include:

A new responsive layout optimized for both desktop and mobile.

A modern light color scheme with a toggle for night/dark mode.

A completely new design for the sign-on and create account interfaces.

Fully functioning navigation and internal links.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The product is a functioning stock analysis website with two core features:

Stock Analyzer

Power Plays

This SRS applies to the UI Layer only and assumes no change to business logic or databases.

2.2 User Needs
Users require:

A clean, sleek, and modern design.

Seamless mobile and desktop use.

A cohesive visual theme across all pages.

A professional, intuitive sign-in and onboarding flow.

3. Specific Requirements
3.1 Functional Requirements
3.1.1 UI Redesign
Create a completely new layout using modern containers, grids, and spacing principles (CSS Flexbox/Grid).

Use a light-themed color palette with option to toggle to dark mode via header toggle button.

Implement mobile-first responsive design with fluid scaling and touch-friendly elements.

Match all redesigned pages with a shared design system (typography, spacing, buttons, inputs).

3.1.2 Navigation & Links
Ensure all navigation links (e.g., Stock Analyzer, Power Plays, Profile, Sign In/Out) function properly and direct users to appropriate endpoints.

Include smooth transitions between pages.

Sticky header/nav bar with toggle for light/dark mode.

3.1.3 Sign-On/Create Account Screen
Rebuild from scratch: No design elements or containers from current version should remain.

Match style of main site UI (colors, font, containers).

Simplify user flows with clear CTAs (“Sign In”, “Create Account”).

Display input field validation (e.g., email format, password length).

Include password visibility toggle and “Forgot password?” link.

Ensure full responsiveness and accessibility.

3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
3.2.1 Performance
Fast load times on both desktop and mobile.

Lightweight assets (optimize images, use lazy-loading as needed).

3.2.2 Compatibility
Fully responsive design compatible with:

iOS Safari, Android Chrome

Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge on desktop

3.2.3 Accessibility
Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles.

Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.

Keyboard navigability and screen reader support for all elements.

3.2.4 Security
Sign-on/Create account forms must use HTTPS.

No changes to backend authentication logic; ensure front-end securely transmits data.

4. UI Design Guidelines
Typography: Clean, sans-serif font like Inter or Open Sans. Use consistent font sizes and spacing.

Color Scheme:

Light Mode: white background, slate gray text, accent colors in blue or teal.

Dark Mode: deep gray background, white text, same accents.

Buttons: Rounded, hoverable, clear text labels, large tap targets.

Containers: Use cards or panels with subtle shadows and large padding.

5. Assumptions & Constraints
Existing backend (including APIs, user database, and features like Stock Analyzer) will not be modified.

Redesign must not disrupt user accounts or stored data.

Redesign must be completed with zero downtime if possible.
