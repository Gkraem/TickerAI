Version: 1.1
Date: June 5, 2025
Author: Stella Mayo

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the specifications for a major UI redesign and minor feature expansion of the Ticker AI website. While the current backend functionality, particularly the Stock Analyzer and Power Plays, is satisfactory, the user interface needs modernization to enhance usability, aesthetic appeal, and mobile responsiveness.

1.2 Scope
This SRS focuses on:

A complete redesign of the UI to achieve a modern and responsive experience across all devices.

A light theme with an easily accessible dark mode toggle in the header/navigation bar.

UI upgrades for the sign-in and account creation windows.

A new stock sector: Industrials, with the specific inclusion of Republic Services, Inc. (RSG).

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
UI – User Interface

UX – User Experience

RSG – Republic Services, Inc.

WCAG – Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

ADA – Americans with Disabilities Act

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
Ticker AI is a functioning web platform providing real-time stock analysis and strategic trading recommendations. The current UI is functional but outdated. This redesign aims to maintain existing logic while refreshing the visual and interactive layers.

2.2 User Needs
Users require:

A modern, clean, intuitive design.

A mobile-first, fully responsive layout.

Easy switching between light and dark themes.

A polished experience on sign-in and registration pages.

The ability to analyze industrial sector stocks (e.g., RSG).

2.3 Assumptions & Dependencies
Frontend built using a modern framework (e.g., React, Vue, or equivalent).

Backend and data analytics systems remain unchanged.

All stock data sources and APIs are stable and continue feeding data uninterrupted.

Current authentication and session logic is functional.

2.4 Constraints
The current user database must not be altered or reset during the redesign.

All 9 existing user accounts and associated data must be preserved seamlessly across the new interface.

No backend authentication logic should be modified unless strictly necessary for frontend compatibility.

The database schema for user information remains locked during this UI update.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 UI Redesign (Global)
FR-01: Implement a light color scheme using whites, soft grays, and accent pastels.

FR-02: Add a dark mode toggle button in the header/nav bar for immediate theme switching.

FR-03: Ensure all views and components are fully responsive, optimized for both mobile and desktop.

FR-04: All typography and buttons must be accessible, scalable, and touch-friendly.

3.2 Header & Navigation
FR-05: Display a responsive nav bar with logo, links to “Stock Analyzer,” “Power Plays,” and “Account.”

FR-06: Integrate a dark mode toggle in the top-right corner of the nav bar.

FR-07: Implement a hamburger menu for navigation on mobile devices.

3.3 Stock Analyzer & Power Plays (UI Only)
FR-08: Apply new UI styling (card-based layout, sleek data displays, minimal charts).

FR-09: Optimize components for smaller screens — stack, scroll, or collapse where appropriate.

FR-10: Apply consistent hover states, animations, and interactive feedback site-wide.

3.4 Sign In / Create Account
FR-11: Rebuild sign-in and registration windows with the new UI style.

FR-12: Ensure theme toggle is present and functional here too.

FR-13: Use responsive forms with clear input focus, tooltips, and accessible contrast ratios.

FR-14: Provide clear and friendly validation feedback for inputs.

3.5 New Sector: Industrials
FR-15: Add a new Industrials sector tab or option to the Stock Analyzer.

FR-16: Include Republic Services, Inc. (RSG) as a tracked and analyzed stock.

FR-17: Apply the same visual, analytical, and functional features used in other sectors.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
NFR-01: UI must fully load and be interactive within 2 seconds on both desktop and mobile.

NFR-02: Dark/light mode preference should persist across sessions via local storage.

NFR-03: All pages must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

NFR-04: Maintain cross-browser compatibility across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.

NFR-05: Minimize UI bundle size to under 1MB for optimal performance.

5. Interface Mockups (To Be Delivered Separately)
Concepts to be developed in Figma or similar:

Homepage UI with analytics dashboard-style layout.

Mobile-first responsive views for all key features.

Redesigned sign-in / create account modal with clean visual hierarchy.

Toggle switch interaction with live preview.

6. Future Considerations
Add watchlists, personalized dashboards, and alert features.

Expand stock sector options beyond Industrials.

Introduce in-app guided tours or onboarding flows.

Enable social sharing or exporting of analytic results.
